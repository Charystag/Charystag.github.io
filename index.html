            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in mathematics and programming, fueled by a lifelong passion for problem-solving and innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                My academic journey began at the Université Paris-Dauphine, where I discovered my fascination with probability, statistics, and numerical analysis, eventually specializing in artificial intelligence. 
                Wanting to broaden my perspective beyond mathematics, I earned a degree in Philosophy from Paris-Sorbonne in 2022, deepening my critical thinking skills and appreciation for interdisciplinary approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside my studies, I honed my technical expertise at École 42, where I built a robust programming foundation. This experience helped me solidify my skills in languages like C, Python, C++, and Rust, and fueled my interest in automation.
                I’m passionate about streamlining workflows, leveraging tools like Bash scripting, and building custom solutions that make life—and work—more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I'm deeply involved in the art of eloquence and public speaking. As the Vice-President of my university's debate team, I led my team to the quarter-finals, and I later took on the role of Vice-President of the French Federation of Debate and Eloquence.
                I also enjoy sharing my knowledge as a tech trainer, specializing in AI, data management, and foundational programming skills.
                Through both my professional and personal projects, I prioritize clear and concise documentation, knowing it’s essential for sustainable, bug-free development.
                I invite you to explore my repositories, where you’ll find personal projects focused on automation and a curated collection of learning resources aimed at enhancing programming skills.
            </p>
